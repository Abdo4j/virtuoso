            The gun in his hand was simply a tool—but a perfectly crafted one. Gold type was inlaid into the blackish-green metal. It spelled the smith's name: this detail spoke of its creator’s pride and confidence. It was not a Piltovan weapon—those gaudy things that attempted to function with the minuscule amounts of magic available in those lands. This gun was made by a true forge master. Magic pulsed from its bronze, Ionian heart.

            He wiped the gun’s stock a fourth time. He couldn’t be sure it was clean until he wiped it down four times. Didn’t matter that he hadn’t used it. Didn’t matter that he was only going to stow it in the bag under the bed. He couldn’t put it away until he was sure it was clean, and he couldn’t be sure it was clean until he had wiped it down four times. It was getting clean though. Four times makes it clean.

            It was clean, and it was wonderful. His new patrons had been generous. But did the finest painters not deserve the finest brushes?
            The scale and precision of the new device made his previous work with blades seem insignificant by comparison. Understanding firearm mechanics had taken him weeks of study, but evolving his ki techniques from blades had taken months.

            The gun held four shots. Each bullet had been infused with magical energy. Each bullet was as perfect as a Lassilan monk’s blade. Each bullet was the paint from which his art would flow. Each bullet was a masterpiece. It didn’t just cut apart the body. It rearranged it.

                The rehearsal at the mill town had already shown the gun’s potential. And his new employers had been pleased with the work’s reception.
                He had finished polishing it, but with the gun in his right hand, the temptation was too great. He knew he shouldn’t, but he unpacked the black, eel-skin bodysuit. He drew the fingertips of his left hand across the slick surface of the clothes. The feel of the skin’s oily surface quickened his breath. He picked up the tight, leather mask, then—unable to help himself—slid it over his face. It covered his right eye and mouth. It constricted his breathing and removed his depth perception…

                He was putting on the shoulder armor when the bells he’d hidden on the steps leading up to his room sounded. He quickly folded up the weapon and removed the mask.

                “Hello?” the maid asked through the door. The lilt in her voice hinted to an upbringing far south of this town.

        <div class="center">

                “You did what I asked?” he said.

                “Yes, sir. A white lantern every four yards. A red lantern every sixteen.”

        <div class="center">

                “Then I can begin,” Khada Jhin said as he swung open the door to his room.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                The woman’s eyes widened as he exited his room. Jhin was well aware of how he looked. Normally, it elicited pangs of self-conscious loathing, but today was a performance day.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                Today, Khada Jhin cut a slender, elegant figure as he walked out with a cane. He was hunched, and his cloak seemed to cover some huge deformity on his shoulder, but a jaunty stride belied this. He forcefully tapped the cane ahead of him as he marched toward the window. He tapped the frame rhythmically—three beats, then a fourth. His gold sparkled, his cream cloak flowed, and his jewels glittered in the sun.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                “What… What is that?” the maid asked, indicating Jhin’s shoulder.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                Jhin paused for a moment to study the woman’s cherubic face. It was round and perfectly symmetrical. A dull and predictable design. Removed, it would make a terrible mask.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                “It’s for the crescendo, my darling,” Khada Jhin said.

                From the inn’s window, he had a clear view of the rest of the town in the valley below him. This performance had to be wonderful, but there was still so much work to do. The councilman would be returning this evening—and so far, all of Jhin’s plans for tonight seemed… uninspired.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                “I brought some flowers for your room,” the woman said, walking past him.

                He could have used someone else to place the lanterns. But he didn’t. He could have changed clothes before opening his door. But he didn’t. Now she had seen Khada Jhin in his finery.

        <div class="center">
            <p class="text-white">
                The inspiration he needed was so obvious now. So preordained. There was never a choice. There was no escaping the Art.

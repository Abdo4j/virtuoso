            One can travel to nearly any village across Ionia and hear the tale of the Capture of the Golden Demon.
            Depicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the cruel spirit's banishment is still celebrated to this day.
            But at the heart of every myth there lies a kernel of truth, and the truth of the Golden Demon is one far different than the fiction.

            For years, Ionia's southern mountains were plagued by the infamous creature. Throughout the province of Zhyun, and even as far as Shon-Xan and Galrin, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses.
            Armed militias searched the forests, towns hired demon hunters, Wuju masters patrolled the roadsâ€”but nothing slowed the beast's grisly work.

            In desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho of the Kinkou Order for help. Charged with maintaining the balance between the spirit and material realms, Kusho was adept in the banishment of demons.
            Leaving in secret lest the cunning creature be alerted to their intent, Kusho, his teenage son, Shen, and young apprentice, Zed, traveled to the province. They tended to countless families shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for connections between the murders. Soon, Kusho realized they were far from the first to hunt this killer, and his conviction grew that this was the work of something beyond the demonic.
